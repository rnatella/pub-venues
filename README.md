The goal of this tool is to provide you information to decide in which publication venue (journal, conference, workshop) to publish your next paper.

One possible criteria is to look at key references that you have cited in your paper, and where they are published.

This tool goes even deeper. It takes in input a list of papers that you cite in your paper. It will recursively get their citations. Then, it will generate a list of their publication venues.
